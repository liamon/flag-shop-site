# flag-shop-site
This was a project in First-Year Next Generation Technologies that was done over multiple assignments.
We were tasked with building a fake shopping website.
All of our websites had to have some common features, such as a contact form which emailed the maker of the site when it was filled out.
I chose to make mine a site that sold flags.

I've replaced my own address here with `example@example.com`.
For uploading to GitHub, I also separated out the JavaScript from an inline script tag in `top.html` to separate `.js` files in their own folder.

__Note__ that this site uses Apache Server Side Includes, as can be seen by the `.shtml` files.

The flag images on `offers.shtml` come from [FOTW Flags of the World](https://flagspot.net/flags/).
The other images are in the public domain.
